# Getting Started

This is a guide to help you get started with Terramaid! In this directory, you will find a few Terraform files that can be visualized using Terramaid. To kick the tires, try running the following commands:

```sh
cd test && terramaid -h
```

```sh
terramaid --subgraph-name Demo --direction LR --output Terramaid_Demo.md
```

```sh
cat Terramaid_Demo.md
```
